# CBM-IO

Note: this is a part of a larger set of repositories, with [upet_family](https://github.com/fachat/upet_family) as the main repository.

This is the IO board for a re-incarnation of the Commodore B-Series to be used together with the Ultra-CPU board.

It is build on a Eurocard board and has only parts that can still be obtained new in 2025. In fact it uses an FPGA to emulate all the I/O chips of the B-Series.
It uses the [CS/A bus interface](http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/index.html) to connect with the CPU board.

Note: this is a work in progress!
